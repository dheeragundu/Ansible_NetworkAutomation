# Ansible_NetworkAutomation

The directories within this repository contain simple playbooks and minor projects I've worked on/am working on as I teach myself how to automate networks.

My primary source for this exploration of the Ansible tool has been Mr. David Bombal's course on network automation. Other than that, google, stackoverflow and ansible's very own documentation have been my bestfriends.
